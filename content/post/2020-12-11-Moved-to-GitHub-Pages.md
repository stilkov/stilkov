I’ve moved this little excuse for a blog from Netlify to GitHub pages; I maintain the sources for the content there, anyway, and using it for a handful of static files seemed a little more lightweight. (At the moment, I still render the output using Hugo on the command line, but hope to figure out how to use GitHub actions to run this remotely – after all, why not spend a day or so figuring out how to automate something that will take me literally minutes otherwise?)

If you had some issues accessing posts, it was due my lack of DNS skills. Apologies.
