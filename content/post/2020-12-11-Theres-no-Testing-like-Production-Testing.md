One of the benefits of having this little domain outside of the innoq.com realm: I’m much more likely to try things out. I admit this reduces the barrier to writing something quite a bit, even though our internal barriers to publishing couldn’t be much lower than they are. In this spirit, this post might appear in my LinkedIn profile, hopefully not in the wrong place. But hey, no testing like production testing.
