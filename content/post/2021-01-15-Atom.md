Back in the old days, this would have been the very first thing I cared about, but I guess I’m either getting old or I’m actually more reasonable and spend time on content instead of meta issues. Whatever the reason, the site now has [a full text Atom feed](/feed.atom). That’s the saner version of RSS, but if you don’t care about the difference, it should do approximately the same thing for you. Let me know if there are any issues.
